On 64-bit platforms, "compress" some pointers to 32 bits.

Pointers to GC-managed, fixed-size objects are compressed.
This saves potentially a lot of memory.  The drawback is that
it will refuse to allocate more than 32GB of RAM for fixed-size
objects.  (The program can use more RAM in total, e.g. with big
strings, which are not fixed-size objects.)
